title: About
---

Iâ€˜m a software engineer, speaker, and a manager.

I am passionate about writing beautiful code and enthusiastic about all languages that solve problems, but I focus on Ruby and Golang and have the necessary knowledge to create infrastructures that scale in the cloud, especially Amazon Web Services.

I have worked with computer network infrastructure for a long time, but I found myself falling in love with the Software Engineering area after I decided to study the topic in more depth and today I am a leader of software & platform engineering teams.

I use programming as a means to develop people and encourage them to become better every day.
